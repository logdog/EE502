# EE 502
This is a collection of documents for Multivariable Linear Control (EE 502), Fall 2022 at Washington State Univeristy. This includes MATLAB simulations, lecture notes, and code for my inverted pendulum demo which I have built at home.

## Inverted Pendulum Demo
I built a real-life inverted pendulum on a cart demo in my apartment to show off some of the control schemes that we studied in EE 502. This will include a P, PD, PI, PID, Lead, Lag, Lead/Lag, and LQR controller. 


## MATLAB Simulations
The following folders are for MATLAB simulation:
    - [SimplePendulum](/SimplePendulum/)
    - [InvertedPendulum](/InvertedPendulum/)
    - [DoubleInvertedPendulum](/DoubleInvertedPendulum/)
    - [DoublePendulumNoCart](/DoublePendulumNoCart/)
    
## Useful MATLAB Code
    - [SolvingDifferentialRiccatiEquation](/SolvingDifferentialRiccatiEquation/)
